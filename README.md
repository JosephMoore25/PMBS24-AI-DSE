# AI-Assisted Design-Space Analysis of High-performance Arm Processors
This repository contains all the code and scripts to orchestrate SimEng (available at https://github.com/UoB-HPC/SimEng) to mass-run benchmarks, train an ML model on the collected results, and analyse the impact of various architectural parameters.
This work is being pubished at the PMBS workshop at Supercomputing 2024.
